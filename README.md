# Jeopardy
Stuff I've done with Jeopardy (really just my Coryat Scorekeeper and plots of my scores each game)
You can see my full list of scores here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-fdv8IVA4E9_TR52RFQsVBMDPTNURSEW3gvrSQ9JsEg/edit#gid=0
It's really easy to run yourself; either clone the repo or copy and paste the code in coryat_scorekeeper.py.
